# Cyber-Security
This is the collection of my Linux Scripts, Ansible Scripts, and my Network Diagrams
Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers
Three Virtual Machines with dockers, a load balancer, a jump box, and a ELK server with container were configured as a final product of this project
